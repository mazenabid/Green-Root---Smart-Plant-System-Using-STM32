### **These are very important documentations and they are cruicial to understand how the code functions.**

### **Throughout the code, you might find unnecessary documentations like the DHT11.c, adc2.c, and their header files...**

### **They are there because you can add to them and make this work yourself, but for the sake of this project, we won't be dealing wth them.**

### **Watch the video if you are confused on any step throughout this project**

# Note: If you have a slightly stronger Nucleo Borad like the F3,4, or 7 series, you will need to adjust the code.
## You can do so by:
  - Downloading the important documentations
  - Focusing on adding MODEF and AFIO functions
  - Adjusting the ADC to your desired functionalities
